# ArmorEquipEvent

I think the only thing I needa add is dispenser support, don't expect for from me for awhile thought.

Should handle most ways to equip armor and not allow you to spam click equipping armor to get any possible benefits you are adding using the event.

Either create an issue on github or pm me on the spigot site. http://www.spigotmc.org/members/borlea.8882/
