# ArmorEquipEvent

You can either take the needed parts out and stick it into your plugin or compile it as a jar and use it as a plugin depend, either way its useless without adding function to the event.


Should handle most ways to equip armor and not allow you to spam click equipping armor to get any possible benefits you might be adding using the event.

If you find a bug either create an issue on github or pm me on the spigot site. http://www.spigotmc.org/members/borlea.8882/
